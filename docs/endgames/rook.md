# Rook endgames

This section will cover rook endgames.

## Rook + Pawn vs Rook

One of the most common endgames is the rook and pawn vs rook endgame.
Typically, the side controlling the promotion square will decide the outcome of the game but it requires precise play to convert the advantage or hold the draw.

Here are some key positions to practice:

### Philidor Position

The Philidor position is a fundamental position in rook endgames where the defending side can hold a draw with accurate play. The key is to prevent the attacking king from entering the 7th rank.

```
[FEN 8/8/8/8/1kp5/8/7r/2K3R1 w - - 0 1]
```

### Lucena Position

The Lucena position is a winning position for the side with the pawn.
The key is to build a bridge to prevent the defending rook from checking the king.

```
[FEN 3K4/3P1k2/8/8/8/8/4R3/2r5 w - - 0 1]
```
